# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, I document my journey of solving problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) to improve my problem-solving and coding skills.

## About
This repository contains:
- **Solutions to various LeetCode problems** written in different programming languages, primarily in Python, C++, or Java (depending on the problem and requirement).
- **Well-documented code** to explain the logic and approach behind each solution.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference or learning resource. However, I encourage you to try solving the problems on your own before checking the solutions!

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
LeetCode-Solutions/
|-- Problem_Category/
    |-- Problem_Name
        |-- solution.<language_extension>
        |-- README.md
```
Each problem folder contains:
- `solution.<language_extension>`: The code implementation.
- `README.md`: A brief explanation of the problem, approach, and complexity analysis.

### Example
```
LeetCode-Solutions/
|-- Arrays/
    |-- Two_Sum
        |-- solution.py
        |-- README.md
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/LeetCode-Solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific problem category and folder.
3. Read the README.md and study the solution file.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have a different approach or optimization for a problem, feel free to:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Submit a pull request.

Please ensure that your contributions follow the existing structure and include comments/documentation.
